                      <p>The coconut is a common fruit found in tropical climates around the   world. It originated from the coconut palm, a plant pertaining to the   family of the palm ceas, which includes nearly a million varieties.</p>
                      <p>Most   people are familiar with 2 types of coconuts: the fresh green coconut   for water and the brown ripe coconut for the meat. The first one has   great quantity of water and a soft pulp, which is used for cooking to   give light taste to drinks and sweets. This is in the earlier stages of   development on the tree. As the coconut ripens on the tree it turns   brown. It is literally dehydrating on the tree. This is usually seen in   stores with the husk already removed and it looks about the same size as   a grapefruit.</p>
                      <p>Coconut water can be used by diabetics, since it   does not contain sucrose (a type of sugar). It is prescribed by doctors   around the world to help with minor and major ailments of all sorts. The   health benefits are truly astounding.</p>
                      <p>The ripe coconut or brown   coconut has very little water, but it is rich in meat as a result. It is   used as food and in foods, sweets, and desserts . Though the quantity   of liquid is small in this sort, it can be consumed normally.</p>
                      <p>The   ripe coconut brings out the taste of the foods and can be substituted   for nuts and almonds in many recipes, wi th an outstanding flavor. The   coconut's husk in the brown ripe coconut is used in the manufacture of   ropes, belts, carpets, and hats . It can be used in arts and crafts. It   is necessary that it is dried up naturally in the sun or it will   becomeshriveled . Under and after the fibrous husk is removed, the   surface of the coconut is a very hard shell. The coconut shell is used   to make earrings, necklaces and bracelets, cups, bowls, buttons, and   even is used as a canvas for painting.</p>
                      <p>Besides as an arts and   craft function, the coconut's fibrous husk can be substituted as a plant   fiber in the cultivation of ornamental plants like ferns, brom lias,   orchids, sword of Saint Jorge, lilies, begonias, between others. The   great advantage is that his cloth is rich in fibers and helps in the   development of the plants, principally, of the epfitas.</p>
