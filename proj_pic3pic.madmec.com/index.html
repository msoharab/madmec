Madmec,<br />
<p>I had issued you notice for termination of the
project as the contract period is over and the site not functionally
properly conformed  by my attorney and many other users.All activities
are to be ceased. All  communication should be done  by mail only with
cc to my attorney   naveen@deccanlawsquare.com.</p>
<p>The site you have created has lots of coding
issues where proper coding was not undertaken causing glitch in the
website  causing frustration to the users  and damaging the value of
pic3pic and also causing losses to the owner (me) financially and
emotionally. As of now I have no interest in taking  the substandard
product you have created.</p>
<p>After a deep though and also consulting my
attorney, I am come to the decision to terminate the contract taking
my losses.</p>
<p>I was advice to give you a mall to
communicate the termination. If this mail does not satisfy. You will
be sent a legal notice asking you to terminate the project.</p>
<p>Site you have created is useless to me as
it does not work properly. You stop all Hositing activites of
pic3pic.com without demaging the domain name or creating any error on
the DNS.Advance of Rs.72,000.00 you can keep it .</p>
<p>I have no intention of keeping any more
business relation with you.</p>
<p>Any more communication please do through
mail with CC to my lawyer.</p>
<p>I hope you terminate the matter here itself without any more future
legal action.
</p>
<p>Sincerly,<br />
Xavier Malcolm<br />
