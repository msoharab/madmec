            <div class="lead1"> <p>The number of people spending their money electronically is growing at an astonishing rate. Electronic and mobile
                    commerce is an important area for businesses to take advantage of in order to stay competitive, and if companies don't have
                    effective ecommerce solutions then they lose business and end up falling behind. Nowadays, brick and mortar companies need
                    ecommerce to retain and engage their customers. Ecommerce is no longer optional if a business is to succeed.
                    MadMec has been working hard in ecommerce development for years, and we are familiar with all latest information,
