        <h2>Digital Marketing</h2>
        <div class="row col-xs-12 col-sm-5 wow fadeInDown text-justify">

            <p>Businesses today are undertaking digital transformations, rethinking what customers value most and creating operating models that take advantage of what’s newly possible for competitive differentiation. The challenge for business is how fast and how far to go.</p>
            <p>Business leaders have long used information technology to improve productivity and efficiency, reach new markets and optimize supply chains. What’s new is 

                that customer expectations have also changed. People
                everywhere are using social networks to find jobs and  restaurants, lost friends and new partners – and, as citizens, to achieve common political goals. They are using the Internet for entertainment, shopping, socializing and household management.</p>

            <p>How can businesses best respond to this shift? How can they take advantage of the opportunity to innovate, differentiate and grow? And how can they do all this cost efficiently, leveraging and optimizing the newest information technologies as part of their overall physical operations? In our analysis of leading companies and our work with clients, we have found that companies with a cohesive strategy for integrating digital and physical elements can successfully transform their business models – and set new directions for entire industries.</p>
            <p>These companies focus on two complementary activities: reshaping their customer value propositions and reconfiguring operating models using digital technologies for greater customer and partner interaction and collaboration. To do so, they are building a new set of capabilities that allows them to progress along both dimensions.</p>
            <p>To find out how to transform your business model to capitalize on today’s digital age, download the Madmec Institute for Business Value executive report, “Digital transformation: Creating new business models where digital meets physical.”</i></p>
            <p>In today’s digital age, auto companies need to embrace innovation to take advantage of new opportunities in areas such as connected vehicles and mobility services. To help generate new customer value propositions or transform their operating models, these companies need to develop a new portfolio of capabilities for flexibility and responsiveness to fast-changing consumer requirements. Although the path to transformation will vary in different markets, one thing is consistent: Those able to implement new business models based on consumer input could win first choice of talent, partners and resources. As industry leaders, they are likely to stay far ahead of new and existing competitors.</p>
