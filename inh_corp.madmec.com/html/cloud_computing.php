                        Cloud computing has a variety of characteristics, with the main ones being:</p>
                <ul class="lead1" >
                   <b>Shared Infrastructure — </b>Uses a ritualized software model, enabling the sharing of physical services, storage, and networking
                        capabilities. The cloud infrastructure, regardless of deployment model, seeks to make the most of the available infrastructure
                        across a number of users.<br>
                    <b>Dynamic Provisioning — </b>Allows for the provision of services based on current demand requirements. This is done automatically
                        using software automation, enabling the expansion and contraction of service capability, as needed. This dynamic scaling
                        needs to be done while maintaining high levels of reliability and security.</li>

                    <b>	Network Access — </b>Needs to be accessed across the internet from a broad range of devices such as PCs, laptops, and mobile devices, using standards-based APIs (for example, ones based on HTTP). Deployments of services in the cloud include everything from using business applications to the latest application on the newest smartphones<br>
                    <b>	Managed Metering — </b>Uses metering for managing and optimizing the service and to provide reporting and billing information. In this way, consumers are billed for services according to how much they have actually used during the billing period.<br>
