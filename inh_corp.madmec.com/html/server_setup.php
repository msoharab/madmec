        <h2><a style="color:black"> We offer fast, reliable plans for every need - from a basic blog to high-powered site</a></h2>
        <p style="color:black"> A customer needs to evaluate the requirements of the application to choose what kind of hosting to use.
            Such considerations include database server software, scripting software, and operating system. Most
            hosting providers provide Linux-based web hosting which offers a wide range of different software. A
            typical configuration for a Linux server is the LAMP platform: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python.
            The web hosting client may want to have other services, such as email for their business domain,
            databases or multimedia services. A customer may also choose Windows as the hosting platform. The
            customer still can choose from Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby but may also use ASP .Net or Classic ASP. Web
            hosting packages often include a Web Content Management System, so the end-user does not have to worry
            about the more technical aspects. </p>
